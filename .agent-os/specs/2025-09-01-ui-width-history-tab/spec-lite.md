# Spec Summary (Lite)

Optimize the Briefcase Chrome extension side panel to maximize width utilization by reducing excessive padding and add a History tab that provides access to the already-implemented document storage repository. This enhancement improves content readability by using all available screen space and allows users to view, revisit, and manage their previously summarized documents through an intuitive tab interface.
