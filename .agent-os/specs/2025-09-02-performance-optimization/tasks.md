# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-02-performance-optimization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Architecture Foundation & Baseline

- [x] **Establish Performance Baseline**
  - Measure and document current bundle size breakdown by module
  - Record extension startup time (manifest load to UI ready)
  - Capture time to first extraction on sample pages
  - Document current memory usage during typical operations
  - Create baseline report for comparison after optimization

- [ ] **Prepare OpenAI Provider for Lazy Loading** _(Simplified)_
  - Keep existing OpenAI integration as-is for now
  - Prepare OpenAI SDK imports for dynamic loading
  - Create loading wrapper for OpenAI functionality
  - Defer full abstraction layer until second provider is needed
  - Add TODO comments for future provider abstraction points

- [ ] **Split Extraction Logic from Providers**
  - Refactor `extraction-pipeline.ts` to separate core logic from OpenAI-specific code
  - Create abstract extraction interfaces independent of summary providers
  - Establish clear boundaries between extraction, processing, and summarization
  - Update existing extraction tests to use new architecture

- [ ] **Establish Module Boundaries**
  - Define clear interfaces between extraction, providers, and UI layers
  - Create type definitions for cross-module communication
  - Document architectural patterns and module responsibilities
  - Add ESLint rules to enforce import boundaries

### Phase 2: Quick Wins - High Impact Lazy Loading

- [ ] **Lazy Load Manual Selection UI** _(Priority: High Impact)_
  - Split manual selection components from core bundle (rarely used)
  - Implement dynamic loading only when fallback is needed
  - Add lightweight loading indicator
  - Expected impact: ~50-100KB reduction from main bundle

- [ ] **Lazy Load Site-Specific Extractors** _(Priority: High Impact)_
  - Convert GitHub, Reddit, Stack Overflow, Twitter extractors to on-demand loading
  - Load only the extractor needed for current site
  - Keep core extraction logic in main bundle
  - Expected impact: ~30-50KB reduction per extractor

### Phase 3: Extended Lazy Loading Implementation

- [ ] **Split Non-Critical UI Components**
  - Convert manual selection UI to lazy-loaded component
  - Implement async loading for advanced settings panels
  - Split theme and accessibility components into separate chunks
  - Add loading states and error boundaries for async components

- [ ] **Lazy Load OpenAI Provider Dependencies**
  - Implement dynamic imports for OpenAI SDK
  - Split streaming utilities into separate loadable modules
  - Create lazy-loaded API validation utilities
  - Add provider loading error handling and fallbacks

- [ ] **Create Extractor Registry System**
  - Build registry for managing lazy-loaded extractors
  - Add robust error handling for failed loads
  - Implement caching for loaded extractors
  - Update extraction pipeline integration

### Phase 4: Bundle Optimization

- [ ] **Configure Webpack/Vite for Optimal Chunk Splitting**
  - Set up bundle splitting configuration (soft target ~500KB)
  - Configure tree shaking for unused dependencies
  - Optimize chunk naming and loading strategies
  - Add bundle analysis reporting to build process
  - Create feature flag configuration for easy rollback

- [ ] **Analyze and Remove Unused Dependencies**
  - Audit current dependencies for unused imports
  - Remove or replace heavy dependencies where possible
  - Optimize import patterns for better tree shaking
  - Document dependency decisions and alternatives considered

- [ ] **Optimize Production Build Configuration**
  - Configure minification and compression settings
  - Set up differential loading for modern/legacy browsers
  - Optimize CSS extraction and critical path loading
  - Add build performance profiling and reporting

- [ ] **Performance Testing and Validation**
  - Compare metrics against Phase 1 baseline
  - Validate all functionality works with lazy loading
  - Test network conditions and offline scenarios
  - Run comprehensive test suite with new architecture
  - Document performance improvements achieved

- [ ] **Implement Rollback Strategy**
  - Add build configuration for quick reversion
  - Create feature flags for lazy loading features
  - Document rollback procedures
  - Test rollback scenarios

### Phase 5: Monitoring Integration (Simplified)

- [ ] **Set Up Essential CI Bundle Size Tracking**
  - Add bundle size reporting to GitHub Actions
  - Configure size change notifications (informational only)
  - Create simple size comparison for pull requests
  - Keep monitoring lightweight and non-blocking

- [ ] **Add Development Bundle Analysis**
  - Add webpack-bundle-analyzer for local development only
  - Create npm script: `npm run analyze:bundle`
  - Document when and how to use bundle analysis
  - Avoid over-instrumentation in production

- [ ] **Create Minimal Documentation**
  - Document lazy loading patterns used
  - Add simple guidelines for new feature additions
  - Update README with build analysis commands
  - Keep documentation focused and practical

### Phase 6: Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Update Test Suite for Lazy Loading**
  - Add tests for lazy loading scenarios and error handling
  - Create integration tests for dynamic import functionality
  - Update test mocks to handle async component loading
  - Focus on functionality over performance metrics

- [ ] **Simple Regression Prevention**
  - Add soft bundle size warnings (not failures)
  - Document baseline metrics from Phase 1
  - Create checklist for testing major changes
  - Keep focus on functionality over strict limits

- [ ] **User Experience Validation**
  - Test extension functionality across all supported browsers
  - Validate loading states feel responsive (no strict metrics)
  - Ensure no degradation in extraction success rates
  - Verify all features remain fully functional
  - Test accessibility features work with lazy-loaded components
