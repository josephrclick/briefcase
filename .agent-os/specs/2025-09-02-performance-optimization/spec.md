> Spec: Performance Optimization & Code Organization
> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This specification outlines a comprehensive performance optimization initiative for the Briefcase Chrome extension. The primary focus is on establishing sustainable code organization patterns and implementing intelligent loading strategies that prevent bundle bloat as features are added. The goal is to target a ~500KB bundle size while maintaining all existing functionality and prioritizing user experience over strict performance metrics.

The optimization approach emphasizes code splitting, lazy loading, and architectural improvements that support maintainable growth rather than aggressive feature removal or performance constraints that could degrade user experience.

## User Stories

**As a Briefcase user, I want:**

- The extension to load quickly in the side panel without noticeable delays
- All current features to remain fully functional after optimization
- Smooth interactions with no performance degradation during text extraction or summarization
- The extension to not consume excessive browser memory or resources

**As a developer, I want:**

- A well-organized codebase that scales efficiently with new features
- Clear separation between core functionality and provider implementations
- Lazy loading patterns that prevent unnecessary code from being bundled
- Performance monitoring that catches bloat early without blocking development
- Modular architecture that supports independent feature development

## Spec Scope

### Code Organization & Architecture

- Split extraction logic from provider implementations (OpenAI, future providers)
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical features (advanced extractors, manual selection UI)
- Create modular provider system for OpenAI integration
- Establish clear separation of concerns between UI components and business logic
- Implement dynamic imports for site-specific extractors

### Performance Optimizations

- Bundle analysis and optimization targeting ~500KB total size
- Lazy loading of advanced extraction features (SPA detection, manual selection)
- Code splitting for provider implementations (OpenAI SDK, streaming utilities)
- Tree shaking optimization for unused dependencies
- Async component loading for non-critical UI elements

### Developer Experience

- Establish performance monitoring and bundle size tracking
- Create development tools for analyzing bundle composition
- Implement CI checks that warn (but don't fail) on significant size increases
- Document lazy loading patterns and architectural decisions

## Out of Scope

### Strict Performance Constraints

- Hard bundle size limits that would require feature removal
- Aggressive performance metrics that could degrade user experience
- Memory optimization at the expense of functionality
- Removal or reduction of existing features for size savings

### Database or Storage Changes

- Migration from chrome.storage.local to alternative storage solutions
- Changes to document storage format or indexing
- Full-text search implementation (future consideration)

### API or Interface Changes

- Breaking changes to existing OpenAI integration
- Modifications to Chrome extension APIs or permissions
- Changes to user-facing interfaces or workflows

## Expected Deliverable

### Primary Deliverables

1. **Refactored Architecture**: Clean separation between extraction logic, provider implementations, and UI components with lazy loading support
2. **Bundle Optimization**: Optimized build configuration achieving ~500KB target while maintaining all functionality
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Development tools and CI integration for tracking bundle size and performance metrics
4. **Documentation**: Architectural guidelines and lazy loading patterns for future development

### Success Criteria

- Bundle size reduced to approximately 500KB without feature loss
- All existing functionality preserved and tested
- Improved code organization with clear module boundaries
- Lazy loading implemented for non-critical features
- Performance monitoring tools integrated into development workflow
- No degradation in user experience or extension startup time

### Quality Assurance

- All existing tests pass without modification
- Extension loads and functions identically to current behavior
- Performance improvements measurable but not disruptive to workflow
- Code organization improvements facilitate easier feature additions
