  - [x] 1.8 Verify all site-specific extractor tests pass

- [x] 2. Enhance SPA Detection and Dynamic Content Handling
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for SPA detection, content loading waits, and stability verification
  - [x] 2.2 Implement DOM stability detection with MutationObserver improvements
  - [x] 2.3 Add intelligent timeout management based on content type and site patterns
  - [x] 2.4 Create content loading indicators and progress feedback
  - [x] 2.5 Implement retry logic for failed dynamic content extraction

  - [ ] 3.4 Create content density analysis algorithm for main content identification
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement text-to-noise ratio calculation with improved scoring
  - [ ] 3.6 Add visual hierarchy analysis using CSS computed styles
  - [ ] 3.7 Create fallback chain orchestration for multiple extraction strategies
  - [ ] 3.8 Verify all DOM analysis enhancement tests pass

- [ ] 4. Build Manual Selection Mode Interface
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for manual selection UI, region highlighting, and user interactions
  - [ ] 4.2 Create content script for page overlay and selection interface
  - [ ] 4.3 Implement region highlighting with visual feedback and hover states
  - [ ] 4.4 Add click-to-select and drag-to-select functionality with boundary detection
  - [ ] 4.5 Create selection preview with character count and content validation
  - [ ] 4.6 Implement selection confirmation and cancellation workflows
  - [ ] 4.7 Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility
  - [ ] 4.8 Verify all manual selection mode tests pass

- [ ] 5. Integrate Advanced Extraction Pipeline and Add Analytics
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for extraction pipeline integration, success tracking, and performance monitoring
  - [ ] 5.2 Update ContentExtractor to use new fallback chain with site-specific extractors
  - [ ] 5.3 Implement extraction attempt logging and success rate tracking
  - [ ] 5.4 Add performance metrics collection (extraction time, method used, success rate)
  - [ ] 5.5 Create failure pattern analysis for continuous improvement insights
  - [ ] 5.6 Update SidePanel UI to show manual selection option when extraction fails
  - [ ] 5.7 Add extraction method indicators in UI (auto/site-specific/manual)
  - [ ] 5.8 Verify all integration tests pass and extraction success rate >95%
