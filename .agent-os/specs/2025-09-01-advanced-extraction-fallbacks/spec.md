> Spec: Advanced Extraction Fallbacks
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement advanced content extraction fallbacks to handle edge cases where Mozilla Readability and basic heuristic extraction fail. This feature will increase extraction success rates from approximately 85% to over 95% by adding site-specific extractors, enhanced DOM analysis for SPAs, and improved manual selection capabilities.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Automatic Extraction

As a user browsing complex websites, I want Briefcase to successfully extract content from sites that currently fail, so that I can summarize content from any webpage I visit.

When I click "Extract Text" on a single-page application (like documentation sites, React apps, or forums), Briefcase will detect the site type and apply appropriate extraction strategies. It will wait for dynamic content to load, identify the main content container using enhanced heuristics, and extract structured text even from non-standard layouts. If automatic extraction still fails, I'll be presented with a manual selection option.

### Manual Selection Fallback

As a power user, I want to manually select text regions when automatic extraction fails, so that I have complete control over what content gets extracted.

When automatic extraction produces insufficient or incorrect results, I can activate manual selection mode. This will highlight selectable content regions on the page, allow me to click or drag to select the desired text, and provide visual feedback showing what will be extracted. Once selected, the content is immediately available for summarization.

## Spec Scope

1. **Site-Specific Extractors** - Implement custom extraction logic for common platforms (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit, Twitter/X, documentation sites)
2. **Enhanced SPA Detection** - Detect and wait for dynamic content loading with intelligent timeout management and content stability verification
3. **Improved DOM Analysis** - Advanced heuristics to identify main content containers using semantic HTML5 elements, ARIA roles, and content density analysis
4. **Manual Selection Mode** - Interactive UI for user-guided text selection with visual feedback and region highlighting
5. **Extraction Analytics** - Track extraction success rates and failure patterns to guide future improvements

## Out of Scope

- Extraction from PDFs (handled by separate feature)
- Video transcription or audio content extraction
- Image OCR or text extraction from images
- Cross-frame extraction from iframes with different origins
- Extraction from password-protected or paywalled content

## Expected Deliverable

1. Extraction success rate increases to >95% across tested sites, with site-specific extractors working for major platforms
2. Manual selection mode accessible via UI button when extraction fails, with clear visual indicators and smooth interaction
3. Performance maintained with extraction completing within 5 seconds for 90% of pages, including SPA content loading time
