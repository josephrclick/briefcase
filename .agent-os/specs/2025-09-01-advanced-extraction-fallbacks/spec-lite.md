# Advanced Extraction Fallbacks - Lite Summary

Implement advanced content extraction fallbacks to increase success rates from 85% to >95% by adding site-specific extractors for major platforms, enhanced SPA detection with dynamic content handling, and manual selection mode as the final fallback. The feature maintains performance requirements while providing users complete control over content extraction when automatic methods fail.

## Key Points

- Site-specific extractors for major platforms (Medium, Substack, LinkedIn, Reddit, GitHub, etc.)
- Enhanced SPA detection with dynamic content handling and MutationObserver improvements
- Manual selection mode as final fallback allowing users to select content directly on the page
