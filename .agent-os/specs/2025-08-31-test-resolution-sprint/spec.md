# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Test Resolution Sprint
> Created: 2025-08-31

## Overview

Fix all 45 failing tests in the Briefcase extension test suite caused by recent API key validation changes and integration test issues. This sprint ensures a stable, fully passing test suite as a foundation for continued development.

## User Stories

### Developer Test Confidence

As a developer, I want all tests to pass consistently, so that I can confidently make changes and deploy new features.

When I run the test suite, all 199 tests should pass without errors. The tests should accurately reflect the current implementation, including the new API key validation requirements for 40+ character keys supporting both standard and project-scoped OpenAI formats. This gives me confidence that my changes don't break existing functionality.

### Continuous Integration Reliability

As a team lead, I want a stable test suite for CI/CD pipelines, so that we can automate deployments with confidence.

The test suite should run reliably in CI environments with consistent results. All mocking should work correctly without relying on external services or browser APIs. This enables automated testing on every commit and prevents broken code from reaching production.

## Spec Scope

1. **API Key Test Updates** - Update all test API keys to meet the new 40+ character validation requirement
2. **Validation Logic Fixes** - Fix test assertions expecting old 20-character minimum validation
3. **Chrome API Mocking** - Resolve integration test failures due to missing Chrome tab mocks
4. **Streaming Test Fixes** - Fix AbortController/AbortSignal issues in streaming cancellation tests
5. **Test Consistency** - Ensure all test fixtures and mocks use consistent, valid data

## Out of Scope

- Adding new test coverage for untested code
- Refactoring test structure or organization
- Performance optimization of test execution
- Adding new testing frameworks or tools
- Implementing E2E browser automation tests

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 199 tests pass successfully with zero failures
2. Test suite runs consistently in both local and CI environments
3. Mock API keys updated to valid 40+ character format across all test files
