> Spec: Export Summaries Feature
> Created: 2025-08-31

## Overview

Implement an export functionality that allows users to download their stored summaries in popular formats (JSON, Markdown, CSV) for backup, sharing, or use in external tools. This feature will enable users to preserve their summarized content beyond the browser's local storage and integrate with their existing knowledge management workflows.

## User Stories

### Data Backup and Portability

As a knowledge worker, I want to export all my summaries to a file, so that I can back up my data and ensure I don't lose valuable insights if I switch browsers or devices.

Users can access an export option from the settings or recent documents section, select their preferred format (JSON for technical users, Markdown for note-taking apps, CSV for spreadsheets), choose between exporting all summaries or a date range, and receive a downloadable file containing their data with proper formatting and metadata preservation.

### Content Sharing and Collaboration

As a researcher, I want to export specific summaries as Markdown files, so that I can share key insights with colleagues or include them in project documentation.

Users can select individual summaries from the recent documents list, choose to export them as formatted Markdown with proper headings and bullet points, and receive a clean file ready for sharing via email, Slack, or integration into documentation systems.

### External Tool Integration

As a power user, I want to export summaries in structured formats, so that I can import them into my personal knowledge management system or database.

Users can export summaries with full metadata including URLs, creation dates, word counts, and structured summary content that can be easily parsed by external tools like Obsidian, Notion, or custom scripts.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-format Export Support** - Download summaries as JSON, Markdown, or CSV files with proper formatting and metadata
2. **Flexible Selection Options** - Export all summaries, date ranges, or individual selections from the recent documents list
3. **Metadata Preservation** - Include original URLs, titles, creation dates, word counts, and summary structure in exports
4. **Chrome Download Integration** - Use Chrome's download API to save files directly to the user's default downloads folder
5. **Export Progress Indication** - Show loading state and progress feedback during large exports

## Out of Scope

- Cloud-based export or synchronization features
- Integration with specific external services (Notion, Obsidian APIs)
- Bulk import functionality (reverse operation)
- Advanced filtering options beyond date ranges
- Custom export templates or format customization
- Scheduled or automatic exports

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Export functionality accessible from settings panel** - Users can trigger exports through a clearly visible export section in settings
2. **Multiple file formats generated correctly** - JSON maintains full data structure, Markdown creates readable formatted text, CSV provides tabular data for analysis
3. **Downloaded files contain complete summary data** - All metadata, original text excerpts, and formatted summaries are preserved in the chosen format
