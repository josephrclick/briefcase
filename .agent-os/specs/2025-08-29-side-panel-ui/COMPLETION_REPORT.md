- Clear indicators of mock status
- Ready for backend integration

## Known Issues (Acceptable for UI Sprint)

1. **Settings Tests**: 3 tests fail because chrome.storage.local isn't actually called in mock mode
2. **No Content Script**: Intentionally deferred to next sprint
3. **No OpenAI Integration**: Intentionally deferred to future sprint

## Files Modified

- apps/extension/sidepanel/App.tsx
- apps/extension/sidepanel/Settings.tsx
- apps/extension/sidepanel/Summarizer.tsx
- apps/extension/sidepanel/RecentList.tsx
- apps/extension/sidepanel/DocumentViewer.tsx
- apps/extension/sidepanel/index.css
- apps/extension/sidepanel/\*.test.tsx (test updates)
- apps/extension/package.json (dependencies)
- apps/extension/tsconfig.json (exclude test files)

## Next Steps

Ready for next sprints in roadmap:

1. Content extraction using Readability
2. OpenAI integration with streaming
3. Local storage repository implementation

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Build extension
cd apps/extension && npm run build

# Run tests

## Conclusion
