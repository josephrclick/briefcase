> Spec: Content Extraction Using Readability
> Created: 2025-08-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement reliable content extraction from web pages using Mozilla Readability library with fallback strategies. This feature will enable accurate text extraction from articles and content pages for summarization while handling edge cases gracefully.

## User Stories

### Article Reader

As a user browsing news articles, I want to extract and summarize article content reliably, so that I can quickly understand key points without reading the full text.

The user navigates to a news article or blog post and activates the Briefcase extension. The system automatically extracts the main article content, preserving text structure, code blocks, and noting image presence. If extraction fails, the user can manually select text to summarize.

### Technical Content Consumer

As a developer reading technical documentation, I want to preserve code blocks and technical formatting, so that extracted content maintains its technical accuracy.

When viewing technical documentation or tutorials, the extension extracts content while preserving code blocks, inline code, and technical formatting. The system notes when images or diagrams are present in the original content.

### Fallback User

As a user on a page where automatic extraction fails, I want to manually select content for summarization, so that I can still use the extension on any page.

On pages where Readability and heuristic extraction fail (complex SPAs, non-article pages), the user can manually select text on the page. The selected text is then sent for summarization with appropriate metadata.

## Spec Scope

1. **Mozilla Readability Integration** - Primary extraction using Readability library for article-like content
2. **DOM Heuristic Fallback** - Simple fallback extracting largest text blocks when Readability fails
3. **Manual Text Selection** - User-initiated text selection for failed automatic extraction
4. **Content Preservation** - Maintain code blocks, technical content, and note image presence
5. **Metadata Collection** - Capture URL and extraction timestamp for context

## Out of Scope

- Content-derived metadata extraction (author, publish date from content)
- Image extraction or processing
- Performance optimization (caching, web workers)
- Site-specific extraction patterns
- Multi-page article handling
- PDF or iframe content extraction

## Expected Deliverable

1. Successful extraction from 90% of standard article/blog pages using Readability
2. Fallback extraction providing usable content when Readability fails
3. Manual selection mode accessible via UI when automatic extraction produces insufficient content
