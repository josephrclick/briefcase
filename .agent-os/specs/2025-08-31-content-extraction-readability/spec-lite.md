# Content Extraction Readability - Lite Summary

Implement reliable content extraction from web pages using Mozilla Readability library with DOM heuristic fallback and manual selection option. The system extracts article content while preserving code blocks and technical formatting, captures metadata (URL and timestamp), and provides users with manual text selection when automatic extraction fails.

## Key Points

- Mozilla Readability as primary extraction method with 800+ character validation
- DOM heuristic fallback using largest content blocks when Readability fails
- Manual text selection UI for edge cases where automatic methods don't work
- Preserve technical formatting including code blocks and structured content
- Comprehensive metadata capture (URL, title, timestamp, extraction method used)
