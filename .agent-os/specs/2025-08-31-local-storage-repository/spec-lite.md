# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a local storage repository that automatically saves summarized documents to chrome.storage.local with FIFO retention at 200 documents. The system maintains a docs:index array for efficient listing, saves documents with doc:<id> keys, and integrates with the existing summarization flow to provide persistent history access through the Recent Documents UI.
