This recaps what was built for Task 3 of the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-export-summaries-feature/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented Chrome Downloads API Integration (Task 3) as part of the export summaries feature. This foundational component enables the extension to download exported content files directly to the user's browser downloads folder. The implementation includes comprehensive error handling, progress tracking, retry mechanisms, and support for multiple file formats with proper MIME type configuration.

Key accomplishments:

- Chrome extension manifest updated with downloads permission
- Downloads API integration with progress tracking and cancellation support
- File format handling for JSON, Markdown, and CSV exports
- Retry mechanism for failed downloads
- Browser download preferences compatibility
- Comprehensive test suite with 35 passing tests covering all functionality

## Context

Implement export functionality allowing users to download stored summaries in JSON, Markdown, or CSV formats for backup, sharing, and external tool integration. Users can export all summaries or specific selections with complete metadata preservation through Chrome's download API.
