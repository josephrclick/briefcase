# 2025-08-31 Recap: Content Extraction & Readability

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-content-extraction-readability/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented a robust three-tier content extraction system for the Briefcase Chrome extension with Mozilla Readability as the primary method, DOM heuristics as a fallback, and manual text selection for edge cases. The system includes:

- **Mozilla Readability Integration**: Industry-standard article extraction with `isProbablyReaderable` validation, document cloning to prevent DOM mutations, and minimum 800-character content enforcement
- **DOM Heuristic Fallback**: Intelligent content detection using semantic elements, text density calculations, and navigation/footer stripping when Readability fails
- **Manual Text Selection**: User-controlled extraction with 100+ character validation, visual indicators, and message passing to the side panel
- **Content Processing Pipeline**: Text normalization with code block preservation, metadata collection (URL, timestamp, extraction method), and DOM stability detection
- **Extension Architecture Integration**: Complete content script implementation, background worker message passing, error handling for unsupported pages (PDFs, iframes), and comprehensive test coverage

## Context

The Content Extraction & Readability system provides reliable, privacy-focused text extraction from web pages for the Briefcase Chrome extension. It enables users to capture article content through multiple methods, ensuring high success rates across diverse website architectures while maintaining technical content formatting. The three-tier approach (Readability → Heuristics → Manual) ensures content can be extracted from virtually any webpage, addressing edge cases like dynamically loaded content, non-standard layouts, and paywall-protected articles through user selection.
