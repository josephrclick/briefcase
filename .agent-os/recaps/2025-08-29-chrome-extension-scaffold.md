# 2025-08-29 Recap: Chrome Extension Scaffold

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-29-chrome-extension-scaffold/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully established a complete Chrome extension foundation with Manifest V3 configuration, build system, and functional side panel. The scaffold provides a production-ready development environment with TypeScript, React, Vite bundling, and hot reload capabilities that enables rapid development of the Briefcase extension features.

Key achievements:

- Complete project structure in `/apps/extension` with organized subdirectories for sidepanel, content, background, lib, and styles
- Fully configured Manifest V3 extension with side panel support, essential permissions, and Chrome 114+ compatibility
- Production-ready build system using Vite and CRXJS plugin with TypeScript support and development hot reload
- Functional React-based side panel that displays in Chrome when extension icon is clicked
- Background service worker with message passing infrastructure for component communication
- Comprehensive testing validation confirming extension loads without errors and all functionality works as expected

## Context

Establish a foundational Chrome extension structure with Manifest V3 configuration that supports side panel functionality and essential permissions. This scaffold serves as the base for the Briefcase extension, providing the project structure, build system with Vite and CRXJS, and a minimal React/Preact side panel that confirms the extension is active.
