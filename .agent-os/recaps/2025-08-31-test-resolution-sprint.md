# 2025-08-31 Recap: Test Resolution Sprint

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-test-resolution-sprint/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully resolved all 45 failing tests in the Briefcase extension test suite, achieving a stable foundation with all 199 tests passing consistently. The sprint focused on updating test infrastructure to support the new API key validation requirements and fixing Chrome API mocking issues:

- **API Key Validation Test Updates**: Created shared test constants with valid 40+ character mock keys, updated all test files (openai-provider.test.ts, settings-service.test.ts, Settings.test.tsx) to use new key format, and fixed validation assertions to expect 40+ character minimum instead of previous 20+ character requirement
- **Chrome API Mocking Infrastructure**: Implemented proper Chrome tabs mock with active tab data, fixed "No active tab found" errors in SidePanel.integration.test.tsx, ensured Chrome storage mocks work correctly across all integration tests, and established reliable mocking patterns for browser API dependencies
- **Streaming and AbortController Fixes**: Created proper AbortController/AbortSignal mocks for JSDOM environment, resolved streaming cancellation test failures, added cleanup in test teardown to prevent memory leaks, and fixed streaming response handling in test scenarios
- **Test Data Consistency**: Standardized mock API keys across all test files using `sk-test1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456` format, updated EnhancedSettings.test.tsx and background message handler tests, eliminated inconsistent test fixtures, and ensured all tests use valid data that matches production validation rules
- **Comprehensive Verification**: Ran complete test suite with coverage reporting, confirmed zero test failures and no console errors, validated consistent test execution in both local and CI environments, and documented test-specific patterns for future development

## Context

The Test Resolution Sprint addressed critical test suite stability issues that emerged after implementing enhanced API key validation for OpenAI integration. The original validation changes required 40+ character API keys to support both standard (`sk-*`) and project-scoped (`sk-proj-*`) OpenAI key formats, but existing tests used shorter mock keys that no longer passed validation. Additionally, integration tests suffered from incomplete Chrome API mocking, particularly around tab management, and streaming tests encountered AbortController compatibility issues in the JSDOM test environment. This sprint systematically resolved all test failures while maintaining the integrity of the new validation logic, establishing a robust testing foundation that supports continued development with confidence. The completed work ensures developers can rely on the test suite for accurate feedback and CI/CD pipelines can automatically validate changes without false failures.
