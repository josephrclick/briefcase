# 2025-09-01 Recap: Advanced Extraction Fallbacks - Site-Specific Extractors

This recaps the completed implementation of Task 1 from the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-advanced-extraction-fallbacks/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully completed Task 1: Site-Specific Extractors implementation, delivering a comprehensive site-specific content extraction system that significantly improves extraction success rates for major web platforms. This implementation provides specialized extraction logic for GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit, Twitter/X, and documentation sites, each optimized to handle the unique DOM structures and content patterns of these platforms.

Key achievements for Task 1:

- **SiteExtractorFactory Registry System**: Built comprehensive extractor registry with priority-based selection, pattern matching, and fallback logic in `/apps/extension/lib/extraction/registry/site-extractor-factory.ts`. The factory supports dynamic extractor registration, automatic sorting by priority, and URL-based extractor selection with document validation.

- **GitHub Extractor**: Implemented specialized GitHub content extraction in `/apps/extension/lib/extraction/extractors/github-extractor.ts` supporting README files with markdown formatting, issue and pull request descriptions with structured content, discussion threads, and code file viewing with syntax preservation. Handles GitHub's complex DOM structure with targeted selectors for `.markdown-body`, `.js-issue-title`, `.gh-header-title`, and `.blob-wrapper` elements.

- **Stack Overflow Extractor**: Created Stack Overflow-specific extraction logic in `/apps/extension/lib/extraction/extractors/stackoverflow-extractor.ts` that captures question titles, detailed question bodies with code examples, all answer content including accepted answers, and properly formatted code blocks. Uses targeted selectors for `.question-hyperlink`, `.s-prose js-post-body`, and `.answercell` elements.

- **Reddit Extractor**: Built Reddit content extraction in `/apps/extension/lib/extraction/extractors/reddit-extractor.ts` supporting post titles and content, comment threads with nested structure, and both old and new Reddit layouts. Handles Reddit's dynamic content with selectors for `[data-test-id="post-content"]`, `.Comment`, and various thread content containers.

- **Twitter/X Extractor**: Implemented Twitter content extraction in `/apps/extension/lib/extraction/extractors/twitter-extractor.ts` for individual tweets and threaded content. Extracts tweet text from `[data-testid="tweetText"]` elements and handles both twitter.com and x.com domains with mobile subdomain support.

- **Documentation Extractor**: Created documentation site extraction in `/apps/extension/lib/extraction/extractors/documentation-extractor.ts` with enhanced semantic analysis for technical documentation. Detects documentation frameworks (GitBook, Sphinx, Docusaurus, Read the Docs) and uses semantic HTML5 elements (article, main, section) with priority-based content selection.

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Implemented complete test suite in `/apps/extension/lib/extraction/extractors/site-extractors.test.ts` with 28 passing tests covering all extractor functionality, URL pattern matching, content extraction accuracy, priority system validation, and edge case handling. Tests validate proper content formatting, code block preservation, and minimum content length requirements.

## Context

The Site-Specific Extractors feature addresses the core limitation where Mozilla Readability and basic heuristic extraction fail on complex modern websites. This implementation targets major platforms where users frequently consume technical content: GitHub for code repositories and project documentation, Stack Overflow for programming Q&A, Reddit for community discussions, Twitter/X for real-time updates and threads, and documentation sites for technical references. Each extractor is specifically tuned to the DOM structure and content patterns of its target platform, using priority-based selection (priority 10 for platform-specific extractors, priority 5 for documentation sites) to ensure the most appropriate extractor handles each URL. The factory pattern enables easy extensibility for future site support while maintaining clean separation of concerns. This represents the foundation of the advanced extraction fallbacks system, with the complete 28-test suite providing robust validation that site-specific extraction works correctly across all supported platforms. This implementation moves Briefcase closer to the target >95% extraction success rate by handling previously problematic sites through specialized extraction logic.
