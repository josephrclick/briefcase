# 2025-08-31 Recap: Local Storage Repository

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-local-storage-repository/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a comprehensive local storage repository system that automatically saves summarized documents to chrome.storage.local with FIFO retention at 200 documents. The system provides persistent document history, automatic storage management, and seamless integration with the existing summarization workflow, transforming the extension from a session-based tool into a fully functional knowledge management system.

Key achievements:

- **Document Repository Service**: Complete TypeScript service class with robust chrome.storage.local integration, document CRUD operations (save, get, delete, clear), structured document storage with doc:<id> keys and docs:index array, comprehensive error handling with retry logic, and storage monitoring with getBytesInUse tracking
- **FIFO Retention Logic**: Automatic document limit enforcement at exactly 200 documents, oldest document removal when capacity exceeded, efficient index management for chronological ordering, storage quota monitoring and error handling, and comprehensive testing with 200+ document scenarios
- **Summarization Flow Integration**: Seamless document saving after successful summarization completion, background script message handling for document operations, SidePanel.tsx integration with automatic save triggers, proper error propagation and user feedback, and complete workflow from extraction to persistent storage
- **Recent Documents UI Enhancement**: Real storage-backed document listing replacing mock data, functional delete operations with immediate UI updates, loading and error states for document operations, structured display of saved summaries with metadata, and responsive design maintaining side panel constraints
- **End-to-End System Validation**: Complete document lifecycle testing from summarization to storage to retrieval, extension reload persistence verification, FIFO capacity testing with edge cases, storage quota error handling validation, and comprehensive test coverage across all components ensuring production readiness

## Context

The Local Storage Repository system enables automatic persistence of summarized documents in chrome.storage.local with intelligent storage management through FIFO retention at 200 documents. This feature transforms the Briefcase extension from a session-based summarization tool into a comprehensive knowledge management system, allowing users to build and access a personal archive of AI-summarized content. The implementation maintains the extension's privacy-first architecture by storing all data locally while providing robust document management, efficient retrieval, and automatic cleanup to prevent storage overflow. Users can now summarize articles with confidence that their summaries will be preserved and accessible through the Recent Documents interface, creating a valuable long-term knowledge repository without requiring cloud storage or external dependencies.
