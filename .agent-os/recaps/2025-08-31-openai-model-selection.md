# 2025-08-31 Recap: OpenAI Model Selection

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-openai-model-selection/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented comprehensive OpenAI model selection functionality that allows users to choose between three optimized models (GPT-5-nano, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4.1-nano) with automatic parameter adaptation ensuring API compatibility. The Briefcase extension now provides flexible model options that optimize for different use cases while maintaining seamless operation through intelligent parameter mapping based on model family requirements.

Key achievements:

- **Settings Data Model Enhancement**: Implemented robust settings data model with OpenAIModel type definition supporting three models, added selectedModel field to SettingsData interface with proper typing, established "gpt-4o-mini" as sensible default for balanced performance, created saveModelSelection method in SettingsService for persistence, and comprehensive test coverage ensuring reliable settings management across all model selection scenarios
- **Model Parameter Mapping Logic**: Created intelligent getModelParameters function that automatically adapts API parameters based on model family, implemented GPT-5 family support (gpt-5-nano, gpt-4.1-nano) with verbosity and reasoning_effort parameters while omitting temperature, maintained GPT-4 family support (gpt-4o-mini) with traditional temperature parameter while omitting GPT-5-specific parameters, updated OpenAIProvider constructor to accept optional model parameter, and thorough testing ensuring parameter compatibility across all supported models
- **UI Component Integration**: Added intuitive model selection dropdown in EnhancedSettings component with user-friendly display names, implemented proper onChange handling for immediate model selection persistence, streamlined settings interface by removing redundant "Change API Key" button while preserving expand/collapse functionality, positioned model selector logically below API key configuration, and comprehensive testing ensuring dropdown functionality and state management work correctly
- **Legacy Code Cleanup**: Systematically removed all references to deprecated models including gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4o, updated CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect current supported model set, cleaned up test fixtures and inline comments referencing outdated models, ensured codebase consistency with new three-model standard, and verification testing confirming no deprecated model references remain in the codebase
- **Integration Testing and Validation**: Verified API calls succeed with all three models using correct parameter sets, tested model switching functionality with proper parameter adaptation, validated settings persistence across extension restarts, ensured streaming responses work correctly with all supported models, and comprehensive test suite execution confirming full feature stability and reliability

## Context

The OpenAI Model Selection feature represents a strategic enhancement to the Briefcase extension's AI capabilities, providing users with choice and optimization options while maintaining technical robustness. This implementation addresses the evolving OpenAI model landscape by supporting both traditional GPT-4 models and newer GPT-5 family models, each with distinct parameter requirements. The automatic parameter adaptation ensures users never encounter API errors due to incompatible parameter configurations, while the intuitive dropdown interface makes model selection accessible without technical knowledge. By removing legacy model references and streamlining the settings interface, this feature establishes a clean foundation for future model additions while maintaining the extension's core privacy-first architecture and local storage model. The implementation balances user choice with technical reliability, ensuring the extension remains performant and error-free across all supported OpenAI models.
