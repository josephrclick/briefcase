# 2025-08-31 Recap: Export Summaries Feature - Foundation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-export-summaries-feature/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully completed the foundational infrastructure for the export summaries feature by implementing Chrome extension permissions and comprehensive testing framework. This critical first phase establishes the security and API access requirements needed for users to download their stored summaries in JSON, Markdown, or CSV formats for backup, sharing, and external tool integration.

Key achievements:

- **Chrome Extension Permissions Update**: Added "downloads" permission to manifest.json alongside existing activeTab, scripting, storage, and sidePanel permissions, ensuring compliance with Chrome Manifest V3 requirements and maintaining minimal permission set for user privacy, verified minimum Chrome version 114 supports all required APIs including the downloads functionality
- **Comprehensive Manifest Validation Testing**: Created manifest-permissions.test.ts with 19 test cases covering basic manifest structure validation, required permissions verification, downloads permission specific checks, Manifest V3 compliance validation, Chrome API compatibility requirements, and security policy enforcement including CSP and web accessible resources
- **Downloads API Integration Testing**: Implemented downloads-api.test.ts with 16 test cases covering full Chrome downloads API access verification, permission validation and error handling, file download functionality with multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown), data URL generation and encoding, download progress tracking and cancellation, error scenarios and runtime checks, and large file handling capabilities up to 1MB+ exports
- **Security and Compliance Framework**: Established testing infrastructure that validates proper MIME type handling for each export format, ensures restrictive content security policy compliance, verifies minimal permissions approach with no excessive grants, validates Chrome API error handling patterns, and confirms data URL encoding standards for safe file downloads

## Context

The Export Summaries Feature foundation represents the critical first milestone in enabling Briefcase users to preserve and share their summarized content beyond the browser's local storage system. This infrastructure work specifically addresses the Chrome extension security model by adding the downloads permission in a controlled, tested manner that maintains the extension's privacy-first approach. The comprehensive testing framework ensures that the downloads API integration will be reliable and secure when the full export functionality is implemented in subsequent tasks. This foundation enables knowledge workers to eventually back up their valuable insights, researchers to share key findings with colleagues, and power users to integrate summaries with external knowledge management systems. The careful attention to permission validation and API access testing provides confidence that the export feature will work consistently across different Chrome versions and user environments while maintaining the extension's commitment to local-only data storage and minimal permission requests.
