# Product Mission (Lite)

Briefcase is a Chrome side-panel extension that helps knowledge workers and researchers instantly summarize and locally store web articles by providing one-click AI-powered extraction and condensation without cloud dependencies.

Briefcase serves knowledge workers, students, and researchers who need to rapidly digest web content while maintaining complete privacy through local-only storage. Unlike cloud-based summarizers, Briefcase keeps all data on the user's device while providing intelligent extraction with friendly failure modes and real-time streaming summaries that deliver immediate insights without leaving the current tab.
